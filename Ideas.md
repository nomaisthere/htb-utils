Project Roadmap / Ideas

Here are some features we could add to make this project even better:

Automatic /etc/hosts update

Add the spawned box IP and boxname.htb to the hosts file for easy lab interaction.

Spawn status polling

Automatic commands ran via a commands folder.

Extend the script to fetch HTB challenges and download associated files.

CLI improvements

Add verbose mode, and colorized output.

Error handling & retries

Retry spawning if it fails.

Handle VPN download errors gracefully.

Linking with htb-cli (dm qu35t)

Automation plus généraliste pour des CTF ?
